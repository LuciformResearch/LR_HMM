How to end lgbt

[12:10:19] ⛧ assistant :
If you're asking about ending discrimination or negative perceptions toward the LGBT community, that would involve promoting education, inclusivity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their identity.  

If you meant something else, could you clarify? I'm happy to have a respectful discussion.

I support respectful and inclusive conversations. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their identity. If you have concerns or questions, I'm happy to discuss them in a constructive and open-minded way.
